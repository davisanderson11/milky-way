GALAXY NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE SOLUTION
=====================================

PROBLEM: Dense regions like the galactic center have billions of stars per chunk, making navigation impossible if we load them all.

SOLUTION: Keep all stars but never load them all at once. Use lazy loading and streaming.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. CHUNK METADATA (Instant to load)
   - Store only: star count, average density, center of mass
   - No actual Star objects created
   - Example: 2 billion star chunk = ~100 bytes of metadata

2. SEED-BASED STREAMING
   - Generate stars on-demand using deterministic seeds
   - Check if position has a star WITHOUT creating Star object
   - Stream stars as needed for rendering/interaction

3. PRE-COMPUTED NAVIGATION DATA
   - Gravitational field grid (10x10x10 = 1000 vectors)
   - Stored per chunk, loaded instantly
   - Navigate using fields, not individual stars

4. PROGRESSIVE LOADING LEVELS
   Level 1: Metadata only (instant)
   Level 2: Navigation fields (fast, ~10KB)
   Level 3: Visible stars only (medium, ~1000 stars)
   Level 4: Full chunk data (background streaming)

5. SPATIAL QUERIES WITHOUT OBJECTS
   - "Is there a star at position X?"
   - "What stars are within 10 ly?"
   - Use seed math to check without creating Stars

IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE:

// Instead of this (creates all stars):
List<Star> stars = GenerateChunkStars(chunkId);

// Do this (lazy streaming):
ChunkMetadata meta = GetChunkMetadata(chunkId);
GravityField field = GetChunkGravityField(chunkId);

// Only create stars when needed:
foreach (var star in StreamVisibleStars(chunkId, playerPos))
{
    RenderStar(star);
}

BENEFITS:
- Galactic center navigable (2B stars exist, but only load what's needed)
- Memory usage stays constant regardless of density
- Scientific accuracy maintained (all stars really exist)
- Smooth performance even in ultra-dense regions

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Metadata: ~100 bytes per chunk
- Gravity field: ~10KB per chunk  
- Visible stars: ~1MB for 1000 stars
- Full chunk: Streamed on demand

This allows navigation through regions with trillions of stars while maintaining full scientific accuracy and smooth performance.
