# Galaxy Generator Unification Summary

## Overview
Successfully unified the galaxy generation system by eliminating ScientificMilkyWayGenerator and using only GalaxyGenerator for density/population calculations.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Files Created
- **StellarTypeGenerator.cs**: Handles stellar type determination using GalaxyGenerator's density and population systems
- **Star.cs**: Unified star class that uses the new system

### 2. Updated Files
- **GalaxyGenerator.cs**: Added StellarPopulation enum (ThinDisk, ThickDisk, Bulge, Halo)
- **ChunkBasedGalaxySystem.cs**: Now uses the new Star class and unified system
- **GalacticAnalytics.cs**: Updated to use new types
- **RoguePlanet.cs**: Updated to use GalaxyGenerator.Vector3
- **ScientificMilkyWayConsole.cs**: Updated to use new Star type
- **compile-console.bat**: Added new files to compilation
- **compile-visual.bat**: Added new files to compilation

### 3. Key Improvements
- Brown dwarfs now properly generate in all populations:
  - Halo: 2% brown dwarfs
  - ThickDisk: 3% brown dwarfs  
  - ThinDisk: 6% brown dwarfs (reduced in dense regions)
  - Bulge: 5% brown dwarfs
- Unified stellar type determination with proper spectral types
- Consistent use of GalaxyGenerator for all density calculations
- Removed duplicate galaxy generation logic

### 4. Brown Dwarf Types
The system now properly generates 5 types of brown dwarfs:
- L0: Early L dwarf (~2200K, 75-80 Jupiter masses)
- L5: Mid L dwarf (~1700K, 65-75 Jupiter masses)
- T0: Early T dwarf (~1400K, 50-65 Jupiter masses)
- T5: Mid T dwarf (~1000K, 30-50 Jupiter masses)
- Y0: Y dwarf (~500K, 13-30 Jupiter masses)

## Testing
The system should now properly generate brown dwarfs in chunk investigations. To test:
1. Compile using compile-console.bat
2. Run and select option 6 (Investigate galaxy chunk)
3. Try chunks like 260_45_0 or 50_180_0
4. Brown dwarfs should appear in the stellar type statistics

## Note
ScientificMilkyWayGenerator.cs still exists but is only referenced for backwards compatibility in some visualization functions. The core generation logic now uses the unified system.
